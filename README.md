#QUIZ APP
This is a Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly quiz experience where users can answer multiple-choice questions and get instant feedback.

The app focuses on core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering using JavaScript, along with responsive and clean UI design using CSS.

Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of frontend development and problem-solving while creating a complete, functional web application from scratch.
